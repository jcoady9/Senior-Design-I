===============

The goal of this project is to process a simple image into a set of line segments which are then redrawn by a robotic arm built from a robotics kit. We used an Bioloid robotics kit with Dynamixel AX-12+ servos as well as an ArbotiX microcontroller for serial communication with the robotic arm. Image Processing was done using OpenCV 2.4.9.
